# RADEX-1503-1706-CASE
Protective case for Radex Geiger counters 1503 / 1503+ / 1706. Files in STL / STEP

Since aparently noone has made a case for any of these geigers (theyve been out since 2011??) i just quickly whipped up one myself. Might update this in the future of the case has some weakness that i havent found yet? But so far they are going strong, although they dont look the best... Anyway as long as you dont kill your geiger from a 1m drop, its gonna be fine :-D 

Print in TPU With 5% Gyroid Infill with 0.3mm wall thickness to achieve a 2 wall cushion, that absorbs shock super well.
